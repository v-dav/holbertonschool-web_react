## üßê Project Description

This project is designed to help you understand and implement Redux connectors and providers in a React application. You will learn how to connect your components to the Redux store, manage state, and handle asynchronous actions using Redux Thunk. Additionally, you will explore how to use Reselect to improve the performance of your connectors and utilize Redux dev tools for debugging your application's state.

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- Redux connectors and how to use them
- The different functions you can pass to a connector (mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToPros)
- How to map an action creator to a component using a connector
- How to map an async action creator to a component with Redux Thunk
- What Redux Providers are and how to set up your app‚Äôs store
- How you can improve a connector‚Äôs performance using Reselect
- How to use Redux‚Äôs dev tools to debug the state of your application
