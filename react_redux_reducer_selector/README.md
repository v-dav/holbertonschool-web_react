## üßê Project Description

This project focuses on understanding and implementing reducers and selectors in a React and Redux application. You will learn the importance of keeping reducers pure and avoiding mutations, as well as how to use Immutable.js to manage state immutability. Additionally, you will explore how to use Normalizr for normalizing nested JSON data and the role of selectors in accessing and manipulating state. By the end of this project, you will be proficient in writing tests for reducers and selectors, and have a solid understanding of these core concepts in Redux.

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- The purpose of a reducer and the role it plays within your application
- Why a reducer should stay as pure as possible
- Why mutations should not happen within a reducer
- The use of Immutable.js within the reducer
- The use of Normalizr within the app
- Selectors: what they are and when to use them
